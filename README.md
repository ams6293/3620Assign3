Complete the Following Parts:
Part 1
Assume you want to build two functions for discounting products on a website.
Function number 1 is for student discount which discounts the current price by 10%.
Function number 2 is for an additional discount for regular buyers which discounts an additional 5% on the current student discounted price.
Depending on the situation, we want to be able to apply both discounts on the products.
Design the above two mentioned functions and apply them both simultaneously on the price.
Part 2
Calculate the value of mathematical expression x*(x+5)^2 where x= 5 using lambda expression.
Part 3
Consider a list in Python which includes prices of all the items in a store.
Build a function to discount the price of all the products by 10%.
Use a map to apply the function to all the elements of the list so that all the product prices are discounted.
Part 4
Using the concept of object-oriented programming and inheritance, create a superclass named Computer, which has two subclasses named Desktop and Laptop.
Define two methods in the Computer class named getspecs and displayspecs, to get the specifications and display the specifications of the computer.
You can use any specifications that you want.
The Desktop class and the Laptop class should have one specification which is exclusive to them for example laptop can have weight as a special specification.
Make sure that the subclasses have their own methods to get and display their special specification.
Create an object of laptop/desktop and make sure to call all the methods from the computer class as well as the methods from the own class
Part 5
Using the concept of operator overloading in Python, change the behavior of the multiplication operator in a way that multiplication operator behaves like an addition operator.
